- It seemed as if not every fragment had the same loudness, which could cause some confusion while listening.
- About the options: I would have liked to have lesser options to choose from. 'Dissimilar or Similar' would probably have been easier. The two extra 'Somewhat..' options also contributed to my confidence. It made me less confident to choose the 'right' option.
- 60 fragments: that's a lot! Especially if you have to listen the fragments a few times to 'get it' or not. It took me more than 30 minutes to be honest.. I also find it hard to stay focused for half an hour. I think half of it would be a lot better to digest.

On occasion this disturbed my assessment of their being 'from the same tune'. I also used my internal map of spectral shape / dimensions. The reverb time and density of most of the samples maintained an 'identity', which helped group the sounds together. Even if there was a distinct spectral difference, the 'family relationship' [common aspects of processing], would bring the sounds together. As I worked, my concept of ""similarity"" continued to evolve - sorry about that."	Yes	kevin.austin@videotron.ca	3348
