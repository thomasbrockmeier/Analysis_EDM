I sometimes kind of tried to map tracks onto each other, and sometimes I adjusted the tempo in my head to perceive ""hidden similarity"" despite the difference in BPM.",10% to 20%,"Sometimes it was very hard to judge rhythm similarity when pieces had a different BPM. I didn't really know whether I had to adjust the tempo in my head or not. I assumed that I had to for tracks that were, although different, still close to each other in BPM, but for Teardrop this was very hard because I felt like it was sometimes less than half as fast than the compared tracks (nevertheless I was really excited to hear Teardrop).
Also, maybe it would be cool to add a tracklist afterwards for people who want to hear the full tracks (I shazamed a few tunes because I liked them).",Yes,tghendriks@gmail.com,3203
